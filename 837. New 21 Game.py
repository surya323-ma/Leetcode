Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.
Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

  class Solution:
    def new21Game(self, n: int, k: int, maxPts: int) -> float:
        if k == 0 or n >= k + maxPts:
            return 1.0
        dp = [0.0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1.0
        window_sum = 1.0
        result = 0.0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i] = window_sum / maxPts
            if i < k:
                window_sum += dp[i]
            else:
                result += dp[i]
            if i - maxPts >= 0:
                window_sum -= dp[i - maxPts]
        return result
