You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.

A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.

Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.
class Solution:
    def countUnguarded(self, m: int, n: int, guards: List[List[int]], walls: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
        for r, c in walls:
            grid[r][c] = 1  # wall
        for r, c in guards:
            grid[r][c] = 2  # guard
            directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # N, S, W, E

        for r, c in guards:
            for dr, dc in directions:
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                while 0 <= nr < m and 0 <= nc < n and grid[nr][nc] != 1 and grid[nr][nc] != 2:
                    if grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                        grid[nr][nc] = 3  # guarded
                    nr += dr
                    nc += dc

        return sum(cell == 0 for row in grid for cell in row)
