You are given an array of binary strings strs and two integers m and n.
Return the size of the largest subset of strs such that there are at most m 0's and n 1's in the subset.
A set x is a subset of a set y if all elements of x are also elements of y.
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        for s in strs:
            zeros = s.count('0')
            ones = s.count('1')

        # Traverse dp table in reverse to avoid overwriting needed values
            for i in range(m, zeros - 1, -1):
                for j in range(n, ones - 1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1)

        return dp[m][n]
